# Phantom - Technical test

This is my take on the Frontend technical test

You can see it deployed [here](https://vercel.app/)

To run it locally, run
```sh
yarn

yarn dev
```

## Dependencies
The project was initiated with [vite](https://vitejs.dev/) using [this template](https://github.com/fresh-app/fresh-vite-app-react-ts)

I used the [icons](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/components/dropdown-menu) from radix, a minimalist and unstyled componenents library

Tests are written with [vitest](https://vitest.dev/)
